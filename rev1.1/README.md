# DO NOT ORDER THIS

Several mistakes have been discovered since the original creation of this PCB that would make ordering this version a bad idea with the main one being that col0 & col1 in the matrix were shorted due to NPTHs between the two columns' PTHs, acting like a bridge due to the unnecessary cheesy layouts.

## Notes

- The libraries used for this project are [ai03's Switch Library](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid), [ai03's Type-C Library](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Type-C.pretty), [ai03's Random Parts Library](https://github.com/ai03-2725/random-keyboard-parts.pretty), and [Keeb.io's Symbol Library](https://github.com/keebio/keebio-components), [Keeb.io's Footprint Library](https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty), and a random OLED footprint I found in rainkeebs' server.
- You need at least KiCad 6 to open the source files.
